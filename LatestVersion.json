(from error reports)<br><br>A lot of changes happened to the firmware, so you will need to flash new .hex and .bin files regardless of what you are using.<br><br>Note that all 4 shiny hunting LGPE programs have been affected by the new firmware changes due to the game disconnecting all controllers when SR'ing. This \"just happened\" to work in the past, but with the new firmware, it has become a lot more delicate.<br><br>As of today, these 4 programs should be working fine on the Switch 2 (only Gift Reset has been tested). But Switch 1 is more precarious since we are unable to get the ESP32 to reliably reconnect to the Switch outside of the grip menu. (for some reason it works perfectly on the Switch 2 - ironic yes)"
