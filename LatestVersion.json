This \"just happened\" to work in the past, but with the new firmware, it has become a lot more delicate.<br><br>As of today, these 4 programs should be working fine on the Switch 2 (only Gift Reset has been tested). But Switch 1 is more precarious since we are unable to get the ESP32 to reliably reconnect to the Switch outside of the grip menu. (for some reason it works perfectly on the Switch 2 - ironic yes)"
