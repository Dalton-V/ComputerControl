1. Get notified when a shiny is found.
2. Get notified when a long-running program is finished or otherwise needs your attention.
3. Send notifications for live (real-time) hosting.
4. Remotely control your Switch via Discord bot commands. (under development)
5. Remotely start/stop programs via Discord bot commands. (under development)
