# PART 4

This is the fourth step in the process towards computer controlled automation! Below you will find information on how to setup and use the rest of the hardware you bought in STEP 2.

## How it works

In order to use computer-control programs, your computer needs to be able to control your game console (duh!).

The way we do it is by using a serial connection[(1)](Beginner-Windows.md#1serial-connection) to connect the microcontroller to the computer. This allows the computer to take control of your game console. But some programs also need to see the screen! So a video capture card is also needed.

## Before you Begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet all of the following requirements:

1. You have a regular Switch (not a Switch Lite) if you want to use programs requiring video feedback.
      * ***Note that Switch Lite cannot output video. Therefore it cannot run any programs that require video capture. If you wish to pursue this level of automation, it might be worth considering investing in a full Switch.***
2. You have a working microcontroller setup[(2)](Beginner-Windows.md#1serial-connection) and you know how to run microcontroller programs. (See STEP 3)
3. You have computer running 64-bit Windows.
      * As of this writing, no platforms other than 64-bit Windows are supported.
4. ***Windows 11 has problems that are out of our control. Do not use Windows 11. Downgrade to Windows 10 if possible.***
5. Your computer must be sufficiently powerful:
      - If you intend to control **1** Switch: A dual-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
      - If you intend to control **2** Switches: A quad-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
      - If you intend to control **4** Switches: 6-8 cores minimum.


## Step 1: HARDWARE ASSEMBLY

Once you have your hardware, you need to make some connections.

Make the following connections:
- UART cable white (TX) to Arduino pin1 (TX -> 1)
- UART cable green (RX) to Arduino pin0 (RX <- 0)
- UART cable black (GND) to Arduino GND (any one is fine)
- UART cable red (VCC) â€“ leave unconnected

## Step 2: Download the SerialPrograms package.

1. Download the latest version of our programs from [here](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/releases).

> (The link should look like something like `PA-SerialPrograms-0.x.x-xxxxxxxx.zip`)

   * If you get a virus or malware warning, ignore it. These are known false positives. If you don't trust us, the [source code is here](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Arduino-Source/tree/main/SerialPrograms).

2. Once you have downloaded the package, unzip to somewhere you can access later. **Do not put it on Microsoft OneDrive.**

## Step 3: Flash PABotBase into your Device.

The root folder of the SerialPrograms package should have a set of .hex files for each of the different devices.

<img src="/Wiki/Software/images/serial-programs-root.png" height="300">

1. Run the QMK Toolbox program that you downloaded in PART 3.
2. Open the .hex named `PABotBase-Switch-20211025-ArduinoLeonardo.hex` located in the roof of the folder you downloaded and unzipped.
3. Change the MCU to `atmega32u4`.
4. Check the "Auto-Flash" box.

<img src="https://github.com/Ensamma/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Software/images/tutorial-windows-leonardo-2.png" height="600">

5. Plug the Leonardo into your computer.
6. Press the reset button.

<img src="https://github.com/Ensamma/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Software/images/tutorial-windows-leonardo-3.jpg" height="400">

The QMK program will now flash the program to the Leonardo and show a bunch of logging.
Afterwards, the 3 LEDs on the Leonardo should flash in unison for 5 seconds before turning off.

7. Unplug the Leonardo from your computer.

## Step 4: Setup the serial connection.

1. Turn on your Switch.
2. Connect your device (Teensy/Pro Micro/Arduino) to the Switch or its dock.
3. Connect the UART to your computer.

TROUBLESHOOTING: If your UART isn't being recognized, you may need to install the following drivers for your UART:
- SiLabs CP210x: https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/software/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip


## Step 5: Setup the video capture.

1. Connect an HDMI cable from your Switch dock to your video capture card.
2. Connect your capture card to your computer.

Here is an example of a setup after steps 4 and 5.

<img src="/Wiki/Hardware/images/serial-setup.jpg" height="600">

## Step 6: Open up SerialPrograms.

1. Run the `SerialPrograms-Windows.cmd` script.
<img src="/Wiki/Software/images/serial-programs-main.png" height="600">

2. Under the "Serial Port" dropdown, select Arduino Leonardo.
3. Under the "Camera" dropdown, select your video capture device.

If everything worked correctly, it should look like this. Note that you will not hear any sound. (see next section)

<img src="/Wiki/Software/images/serial-programs-setup.png">

**Interpreting the "Serial Port" Text**
1. Red "Not connected" - Cannot open port, or check wires, and drivers
2. Orange "Connecting" - Connected to port, but no response from device
   1. Check wires
3. "Incompatible Version" - Flash your device with the newest PABotBase hex

Output Window (Log):
1. Spamming of "RESET" messages with nothing else
   1. Check your wires
2. Spams of invalid length and CRC errors.
   1. Check your wires.
   2. Make sure you don't have a PLxxx UART Controller (If you do, you need to buy a CP21xx UART)


**Troubleshooting:**

If nothing shows up for Serial Port or Camera, then there is something wrong with your setup.

Common serial connection errors are:
- If the device isn't connecting; Switching the TX and RX connections.
- The serial port is in use by another program.
- The device is not running a compatible program. Meaning, you need to double check you correctly flashed `PABotBase-Switch-20211025-ArduinoLeonardo.hex` to the Leonardo board.

Common video capture errors are:
- The capture card is in use by another program. Close OBS or any other program potentially using the card.
- The capture card is not receiving enough power over the USB connection.
- There are multiple capture cards connected to the same physical USB port on the computer (by means of a hub). (see [multiple capture cards](#multiple-switch-considerations))

## Step 7: Play around with the keyboard controls.

If you make it here, then both your serial connection and your video is working. Congrats! Now it's time to play with the program.

The default program is the Virtual Console. It simply displays the video from your Switch. If you click on the video, it will also activate keyboard controls so you can send button presses to the Switch. This allows you to play your Switch on your computer. Subsequently, this also allows full remote access to your Switches.

To view the keyboard/controller mapping, click on "Keyboard Layout" in the bottom left section of the program.

<img src="/Wiki/Software/images/serial-programs-mapping.png" height="400">

The joystick mappings should be fairly standard for FPS and 3D adventure games. The remaining buttons are somewhat arbitrary and not necessarily intuitive.
As of this writing, there is no support for changing the key mapping.

The playability of this will depend drastically on the quality of your capture card. Some capture cards have very low video latency. Other cards may be too slow to play on the computer in real time. Regardless, even if it is slow, you can use the program for remote access to setup and run programs while you are away.

**Note:** Since `Shift` is mapped to the B button, you will need to disable Sticky Keys in the system. Alternatively, you can press `CTRL` for B. Some buttons have multiple keyboard keys that can be used to invoke it, but they are undocumented at this time.

## Step 8: Run a program.

Now that you know how to use the Virtual Console, you can try running some programs on the left panel. The first thing that you will notice is that every program is a virtual console!

Most of the current programs are identical to the native ones as they were directly ported from device code to computer. Only this time, you can configure and run them with a few clicks. There is no more need to flash the device every time you change programs!

You will notice that the programs are color-coded:
- **Black:** Not a real program.
- **Blue:** Program does not use video feedback. It can run on all devices (including Arduino Uno R3).
- **Red:** Program does not use video feedback. It cannot run on the Arduino Uno R3.
- **Green:** Program uses video feedback and requires video capture. It can run on all devices (including Arduino Uno R3).
- **Purple:** Program uses video feedback and requires video capture. It cannot run on the Arduino Uno R3.

## Next Steps

None. You're done!

# Notes

### Programs do not always need to start in the grip menu.

Many of the programs in SerialPrograms are identical to the native ones that don't require serial. However, you don't always need to start them in the grip menu.
The purpose of the grip menu is to disconnect your manual controller so that the device can take over as the primary controller. But if you're using the keyboard to control your Switch, the device is likely already the primary controller. Therefore, some programs will work anyway if you can start them in the Switch Home menu or inside the game.

### Multiple Switch Considerations

If you have played with the Switch Viewer program, you will notice that it supports multiple Switches. This is a precursor to future releases that may have programs that utilize multiple Switches simultaneously.

However, we have found that setting up the hardware to handle multiple serial ports and capture cards can be tricky. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. And it's often difficult to troubleshoot. This is regardless of whether you are running multiple Switches under the same instance or if you are running multiple instances of one Switch each.

**Serial ports and Cameras can only be used at one place at a time.**

Both serial ports and cameras (capture cards) can only be used by one application at a time. Therefore you cannot view the same video capture from both OBS and SerialPrograms simultaneously. If you want to do this, use the OBS Virtual Camera.

The single-use limitation also applies within the same application. When viewing multiple Switch setups simultaneously, both the serial ports and cameras can only be used at one place at a time. If you try to use the same serial port on a second setup, it won't connect. If you try to use the same camera on a second setup, it won't display.

**Capture Cards don't always play well with USB hubs.**

Capture cards are very hit-and-miss when you try to put multiple of them on the same USB hub.

Some general observations:
1. Capture cards draw a lot of power. If you put them with other high-powered USB devices drawing power from the same source, the card may not function.
2. Capture cards use a lot of USB bandwidth. If you put multiple capture cards on the same USB hub, you may saturate the bandwidth on that hub.
3. For some unknown reason (even when both the above do not apply), it can be difficult to get multiple capture cards on the same physical USB port (by means of a hub) on the computer to work simultaneously. You may need to spread them out. Thus for a 4-Switch setup, your computer will need at least 4 USB ports - one for each capture card. But within each port, you can use a hub to connect *one* capture card and other devices as well. (such as the UART serial connections)
