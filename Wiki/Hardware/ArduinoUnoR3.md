# Hardware - Arduino Uno R3

This section covers the required hardware for users who have the Arduino Uno R3.

***Be aware that the Arduino Uno R3 cannot run all the computer-control programs. As a result it also deprecated. We recommend switching to a different microcontroller if possible.***

## Hardware Requirements

Make sure you have all the [microcontroller and serial hardware](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Hardware/ArduinoUnoR3.md) and [video hardware](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Hardware/Hardware.md#video-hardware).

## Hardware Assembly

Once you have your hardware, you need to make some connections.

Make the following connections:
- UART cable green (TX) to Arduino pin1 (TX -> 1)
- UART cable white (RX) to Arduino pin0 (RX <- 0)
- UART cable black (GND) to Arduino GND (any one is fine)
- UART cable red (VCC) â€“ leave unconnected
