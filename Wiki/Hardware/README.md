# Computer-Control Programs - Hardware Guide

This is the guide for buying and setting up the hardware for the computer-control programs.

If you already have the hardware, skip ahead to the software tutorial.
- [Software Tutorial](/Wiki/Software/README.md)

## Before you Begin

Before you begin, make sure you meet all of the following requirements:

1. You have a working [microcontroller setup](https://github.com/Mysticial/PA-Microcontroller) and you know how to run microcontroller programs.
2. You have computer running 64-bit Windows. As of this writing, no platforms other than 64-bit Windows are supported.

Your computer must be sufficiently powerful:

- If you intend to control **1** Switch: A dual-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
- If you intend to control **2** Switches: A quad-core processor @ 3 GHz no older than 2015 should be sufficient.
- If you intend to control **4** Switches: 6-8 cores minimum.


## Serial Hardware

(introduction)

The serial hardware setup will depend on what microcontroller you have.
