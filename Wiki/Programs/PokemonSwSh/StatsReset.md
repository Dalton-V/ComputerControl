### Default Program Settings

This program requires you to input what stat range you want to search for.

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

### Go Home when Done:

After finding a match, go to the Switch Home to idle. Turn this off for unattended streaming so that your viewers can see the shiny.

Set this to the language of your game. (not your Switch) This is needed for text recognition.

### Gift Pokémon:

The Pokémon you are resetting for.

### Stats:

The desired IV spread for each stat.
