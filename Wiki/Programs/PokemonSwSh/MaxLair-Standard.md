## Program Description

This program runs a DAs with a specific boss until the boss turns up shiny. It does not reset the game or try to preserve balls. Thus the path is random every time.

### Setup of Settings

1. Screen size: Must be 100% within the Switch settings
2. Video Resolution: 1920 x 1080 or higher in program settings.
3. Test Speed: Fast
4. Casual mode: Off

This must be done to all participating Switches.

### Instructions

1. Stand in front of the professor.
2. Make sure you have at least one boss saved.
3. Make sure you don't need to pay ore to start a new adventure.
4. Start the program in game or the [Change Grip/Order Menu](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/ChangeGripOrderMenu.md) depending on which option you choose.

This must be done on all participating Switches.

The program will talk to the professor and start the adventure. It will automatically detect the boss from the silhouette (if available).


## General Options

This program uses [**Tolerate System Update Menu (fast)**](/Wiki/Programs/NintendoSwitch/FrameworkSettings.md#tolerate-system-update-menu-fast) to bypass the system update window.

### Host Switch

When running multiple Switches, this selects which one will be the hosting Switch. The host will be able to pick the boss. Everyone else will join the host.

### Boss Slot

The slot number of the boss.

- Slot 1: The 1st boss on the list. (the top one)
- Slot 2: The 2nd boss on the list.
- Slot 3: The 3rd boss on the list.

### Game Language

This option is a per-Switch option. You must pick the language that matches the game language.

### Normal Ball

This is the ball that will be used to catch all non-boss Pok√©mon.

### Boss Ball

This is the ball that will be used ot catch the boss.


## Hosting Options

### Mode

Pretty self-explanatory. The options are:
- Alone: Run by yourself using only Switches controlled by this program.
- Host Locally: Allow other local Switches to join.
- Host Online: Allow other people online to join.

When hosting, you may not actually be the host. You may join someone else's lobby with a compatible boss selection. In reality, there is no distinction between host and non-host.
The program is fully capable of playing as the non-primary player.

If multiple people (online or not) start the program at the same time with the same code and using compatible boss selections, they will join each other and play together.
This collaboration will continue from raid-to-raid until someone stops or drops out. Thus multiple people can work together using the same program to increase win rates for everyone.

### Raid Code:

See [Raid Code Entry](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/PokemonSwSh/RaidCode.md).

A raid code is required when running multiple Switches. This is because a code is needed to ensure that all the Switches will join the same lobby.
