## Program Description

Keep throwing ball until you catch the Pokémon you're fighting. In case of failure to catch the Pokémon (in case your Pokémon or the opposing Pokémon faint, you run out of balls, etc) it will reset the game and wait until a pokémon attacks you.

2. Video Resolution: 1280 x 720 or higher in program settings

## Instructions
