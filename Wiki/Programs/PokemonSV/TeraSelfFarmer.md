# Tera Self Farmer

## Program Description

This program will date-spam for tera raids and battle them by mashing A (the first move of your lead Pokémon).

This program is useful for farming items from easier raids. It cannot be used to beat hard raids.

This program cannot detect shinies. So it will kill them unless you manually stop the program.

### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast
2. System time: Un-synced
3. Nicknaming must be off.
4. Auto-deposit must be set to manual.

### Instructions

1. You must be facing an active Tera raid crystal facing south, or standing directly on a crystal spawn spot.
2. Your location should be safe from getting attacked by wild Pokémon.
3. Your lead Pokémon should be able to reliably beat raids by spamming its first move. Pick a move that is strong and has few types resistant to it.
4. Start the program in game.

*After completing a raid, your character will rotate to face south. Thus if you aren't already facing south, the crystal spawns may no longer be in front of you.


## Options

### Mode:

- Mode 1: Items only. Don't catch anything.
- Mode 2: Catch everything using default ball.

Mode 2 will look to see if what you caught is shiny and will send notifications.


### Fix Clock on Catch:

Fix the time when catching so the caught date will be correct.


### Max Stars:

Skip raids with more than this many stars to save time since you're likely to lose. 4 star raids seem to be the limit of what can be beaten with this program.
