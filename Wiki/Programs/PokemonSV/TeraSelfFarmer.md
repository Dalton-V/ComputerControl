# Tera Self Farmer

This program is currently in development and is not yet available.

## Program Description

This program will date-spam for tera raids and battle them by mashing A (the first move of your lead Pokémon).

This program is useful for farming items from easier raids. It cannot be used to beat hard raids.

This program cannot detect shinies. So it will kill them unless you manually stop the program.

### Max Stars:

Skip raids with more than this many stars to save time since you're likely to lose. 4 star raids seem to be the limit of what can be beaten with this program.
