### Setup of Settings

1. Text Speed: Fast

### Box Setup

1. Place consecutive empty boxes to host collected eggs. Set the current box as the first of those boxes.

### Instructions

1. You have a party of two or more Pokémon that can produce eggs. Usually one Ditto with one or more other Pokémon. Eggs collected will not fill empty spots in the party. They will be sent to boxes directly.
2. Making a sandwich gives 100 exp to each party Pokémon. Make sure when the program is running, none of your party Pokémon will evolve by sandwich exp.
3. You have unlocked Great Peanut Butter Sandwich recipe (recipe ID 17). The program will make the sandwich to gain Egg Power Lv 2. Without Egg Power, it will be very slow to produce eggs in the picnic basket.
4. You have bought enough ingredients for making the chosen number of sandwiches. Each Great Peanut Butter Sandwich costs one butter, one peanut butter, one banana and one pick. Any pick is fine: the program will always choose the first pick in the pick selection list. You can buy lots of silver picks for the cheap price.
5. Fly to Zero Gate flying spot (see image below).
6. Start the program in game.

### Notes on Egg mechanism

- If there is only one Pokémon in your party holding an item and that item is a Destiny Knot, all the item-free Pokémon can only pair with that Destiny Knot holder to generate eggs. So you can bring multiple native Pokémon to all pair with a single foreign 6IV Ditto that holds a Destiny Knot to generate Masuda-method eggs with good IVs.

- If more than one Pokémon holds Destiny Knot and the rest holds nothing, only the Pokémon with Destiny Knots will pair among themselves. So if you bring two Ditto with Destiny Knots and some other Pokémon without items, you will never get eggs as Ditto won't produce eggs with another Ditto.


<!-- There are two findings regarding egg mechanism:

- Bring Pokémon from same species and from different OTs will increase egg production rate.

- Bring Pokémon from different languages will increase shiny chances (the Masuda method).

Since there is no way to control which two Pokémon in your party will produce an egg together, you will need a special party setting to maximize shiny hunting efficiency.
Use shiny hunting pikachu as an example, you can bring three foreign language Ditto and three native pikachu with same gender.
The same gender requirement is to prevent them from breeding among themselves, producing eggs without the Masuda method.
Alternatively, you can bring three foreign language male pikachu and three native female pikachu as a party. -->
