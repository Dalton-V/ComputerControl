## Setup

1. Your party must only contain a single Pokemon capable of clearing the tournament solo by spamming its first move. (ex. Chi-Yu or Sylveon)
	> This cannot be your mount as the program will use it to return to the academy if you end up at the Pokemon Center.
2. The last Pokemon Center visited is Mesagzoa West. The program will attempt to return to the academy from here if you lose the tournament.

## Instructions

1. Stand in front of the tournament entry NPC.
2. Start the program in-game.

## Notes
- The Turbo A/Turbo Button programs will run through the tournament faster than this, and can be used instead if none of the options (ex. Tera during battle, Prize reading, continuing even if tournament lost) in this program are needed.

## Options

### Number of Tournaments to run:

The number of tournaments you wish to complete.

### Use Terastillization:

If checked, will tera your Pokemon at the start of each battle. Will take much longer to farm tournaments but may be worth the attack boost if your Pokemon isn't specifically built for farming.

### Save every this many tournaments:

Save every x number of tournaments. Zero disables saving.

### Stop after earning this amount of money:

After winning x amount of money, stop the program when the tournament is over. Money lost from losing a battle will not count toward this total. Set this to 0 to disable the setting.

### Go Home when Done:

Go to the Switch Home to idle when finished.

### Game Language:

Select the language that matches what you are using in-game. This setting is required to read prizes.

### Items Table:

Use this table to specify which prizes you want to notified for.
