# Egg Fetcher

## Program Description

A fully autonomous bot that will fetch and hatch eggs and keep all the shinies that are hatched. It can also be configured to breed for IV spreads.

Unlike [Egg Fetcher](EggFetcher.md) and [Egg Hatcher](EggHatcher.md), this program can run completely unattended for many days without intervention.

## Options

### Go Home when Done:

After the program finishes, go to the Switch Home to idle.

### Bike Shortcut:

This is the Dpad button that is used to quickly trigger the bike.

### Max Keepers:

Stop the program once it has kept this many babies. This value should be no greater than the number of free spaces in the last box.

### Travel Time per Fetch:

Spin on your bike for this long before attempting to fetch another egg.

### Error Recovery:

Pokémon BDSP is very prone to crashing.

When enabled, this option, will save the game at the start of the program and after baby that is kept.
That way if the game crashes or the program encounters some error, you won't lose more than too much progress.

### Action Table:

This tables lets you specify the actions to perform on babies that meet a certain criteria.

By default, there is one action which is to keep all shiny babies. (deposit them into the last box)
But you can add more actions to keep babies of certain IV spreads. This is useful if you are still selectively breeding for perfect parents.
