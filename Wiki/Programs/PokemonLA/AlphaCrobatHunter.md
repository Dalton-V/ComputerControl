## Options

None specific to this program.




### Shiny Detected Actions

This program detects shinies by listening for the shiny sound. You can configure what the program should do if it hears a shiny.

**Shiny Detected Action:**
- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pok√©mon will run away from you.
