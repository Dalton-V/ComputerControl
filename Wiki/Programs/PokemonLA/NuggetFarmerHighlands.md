The program will repeatedly warp to Coronet Highlands and try to find and battle Charm.

The chance of finding her on each trip to Coronet Highlands is 1-in-5. In the post game, defeating her will reward you with 4 or 5 nuggets.

If the program finds a shiny, it still stop and go to the Switch home to freeze the game. You can change this behavior in the options.


## Options

None specific to this program.


### Shiny Detected Actions

This program detects shinies by listening for the shiny sound. You can configure what the program should do if it hears a shiny.

**Shiny Detected Action:**
- Ignore the shiny. Do not stop the program.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot. Then go Home.
- Stop program. Align camera for a screenshot + video. Then go Home.

**Screenshot Delay:**

If the above is set to stop on a shiny, the program will align the camera and wait X time to potentially allow the shiny to come into view of the camera.
This has no functional affect on the program. Don't set this value too large as some Pokémon will run away from you.
